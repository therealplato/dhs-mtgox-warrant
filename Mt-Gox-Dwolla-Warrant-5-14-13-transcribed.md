### Probable Cause

The information set forth below is based upon your affiant's review of records
and upon information provided by other sworn law enforcement officers
participating in this investigaion. I have not included each and every fact
obtained pursuant to this investigation, but have set forth those facts that I
believe are essential to establish the necessary foundation for the issuance  of
the seizure warrant for the specified account.

A company called "Mt. Gox," is the world's largest bitcoin exchange, and it
operates out of Tokyo, Japan. Mt. Gox has a subsidiary company known as "Mutum
Sigillum LLC." According to bank records, Mutum Sigillum LLC holds an account at
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The account is held in the business name Mutum Sigillum
LLC, which is incorporated in the state of Delaware. According to Wells Fargo
Bank records, the account was established on May 20, 2011, with the accoutn
number 7657841313 and with a single authorized signer; Mark Karpeles. According
to open source information, Karpeles is the owner of Mt. Gox. According to the
bank records, Karpeles is also the owner of Mutum Sigillum LLC.

As part of the account opening process, Wells Fargo required Karpeles and Mutum
Sigillum LLC to complete a "Money Services Business (MSB) Accounts,
Identification of an MSB Customer" form. That document was completed on May 20,
2011, and identified Mutum Sigillum LLC as a busines snot engaged in money
services. The application asks several questions; to include, "Do you deal in or
exchange currency for your customer?" and "Does your business accept funds from
customers and send the funds based on customers' instructions (Money
Transmitter)?" Karpeles answered these questions "no," indicating that Mutum
Sigillum LLC does not deal in or exchange money, and that it does not send funds
based on customer instructions.

Money transmitting businesses are required by 31 U.S.C. section 5330 to register
as such with FinCEN. According to FinCEN records on May 6, 2013, neither Mt. Gox
nor the subsidiary, Mutum Sigillum LLC, is registered as a Money Service
Business.

Mt. Gox acts as a digital currency exchange where customers open accounts and
fund their respective accounts with fiat currency, which is then exchanged into
crypto-currency by Mt. Gox; the crypto-currency is known as bitcoin. Fiat
currency simply refers to any money that a government has declared to be legal
tender. The exchange is bidirectional and allows customers to also exchange
bitcoins back into fiat currency, and then withdraw those funds. The exchange of
fiat currency and bitcoins incurs a floating rate fee charged by Mt. Gox and is
determined by the customer's aggregate amount of funds exchanged on a monthly
basis. So, the exchange of a small amount of bitcoin would incur a larger fee
than a larger exchange.

An online payment processor, known as Dwolla, is located in Iowa. People can
purchase bitcoin by depositing funds with Dwolla and then directing that the
funds be used to make the purchase from Mt. Gox, which then maintains the
registry of the ownership of the bitcoin. Bank records show a number of deposits
to the Mutum Sigillum account at Wells Fargo originating from international
wires sent from Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in Japan. The wires indicate that the
transfer is in the name of Mt. Gox Company Ltd. for the benefit of the Mutum
Sigillum LLC account 7657841313.

After the funds are credited to that account, they are frequently disbursed to
Dwolla, an online payment service for e-commerce; bank records show such
transfers to Dwolla since at least in December 2011. Dwolla is located in Des
Moines, Iowa. The funds being sent to Dwolla are those of Mt. Gox customers that
withdraw said funds from Mt. Gox and direct their transfer to Dwolla. A
Confidential Informant (CI-1), who resides and banks in Maryland, provided
information to government agents that has been corroborated. CI-1 stated that he
initiated this process by establishing a new account, while in Maryland, with
both Mt. Gox and Dwolla. After funding his Mt. Gox account with U.S. funds, he
exchanged the currency in his Dwolla account for bitcoins. During the past six
months, CI-1 exchanged the bitcoins back into U.S. dollars, which he directed
Mt. Gox to transfer to Dwolla on his behalf. The funds were then credited to his
Dwolla account.

According to bank records, this transfer was completed through the subsidiary,
Mutum Sigillum LLC. This demonstrates that Mutum Sigillum LLC is engaged in a
money transmitting business but is not registered as requried with FinCEN.
Because the 7657841313 account at Wells Fargo was involved in this money
transmitting activity, the contents of the account were subject to seizure and
forfeiture in accordance with 18 U.S.C. section 981(a)(I)(A).

On May 9, 2013, the Honorable Stephanie A. Gallagher issued a seizure warrant
for the contents of the Mutum Sigillum LLC account at Wells Fargo, based on the
foregoing information. Bank records also show that nearly all of the activity in
that Wells Fargo account consists of wires between that account and Dwolla,
which represent Bitcoin transactions for customers. The other transactions in
this account are not significant in number or amounts.

Dwolla records indicate that the destination for the funds wired from the Wells
Fargo account was **Dwolla account 812-649-1010 registered in the name of Mutum
Sigillum LLC, held in the custody of Veridian Credit Union.** Dwolla records
also indicate that the Wells Fargo account was the sole financial institution
account that was funding the Dwolla account 812-649-1010. Therefore, it is
evident that the Dwolla account was the sole financial institution account that
was funding the Dwolla account 812-649-1010. Therefore, it is evident that the
Dwolla account was used exclusively to move funds between Mt. Gox and Mutum
Sigillum and their customers. Consequently, there is probable cause to believe
that Mt. Gox and Mutum Sigillum are using **Dwolla account 812-649-1010
registered in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC, held in the custody of Veridian
Credit Union** to conduct transactions as part of an unlicensed money service
business in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1960, and that the contents of the
account are involved in those transactions and attempted transactions.

Based upon my training and experience, I know that 18 U.S.C. section 981(b)(3)
provides that "a seizure warrant may be issued ... by a judicial officer in any
district in which a forfeiture action against the property may be filed under
Section 1355(b) of title 28, and may be executed in any district in which the
property is found...." According to 28 U.S.C. section 1355(b)(1)(A), a
forfeiture action may be brought in "the district court for the district in
which any of the acts or omissions giving rise to the forfeiture occurred...."
Because the affidavit demopnstrates that transactions through the Dwolla and
Mutum Sigillum accounts were initiated and caused by a customer in the District
of Maryland, the forfeiture action can be brought in the District of Maryland,
and the seizure warrant may be issued in the District of Maryland.

### V. Conclusion

Based on the foregoing, I submit that there is probable cause to believe that
the contents of **Dwolla account 812-649-1010 registered in the name of Mutum
Sigillum LLC, held in the custody of Veridian Credit Union,**  were involved in
transactions and attempted transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1960,
and that the contents of that account are subject to seizure and forfeiture
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 981(a)(1)(A).
